This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project.

Compliments are cool and we should give them more !! 

## LOCAL

This app is not dockerized, so you have to run 2 whole commands.

```bash
npm run dev
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 

## PRODUCTION 

This app is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.com/) because I like trains ðŸš†
